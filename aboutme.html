        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p> My name is Trinise Owens and Iâ€™m a 17 year old, currently enrolled in BMCC, as a freshman. I was born and raised in Coney Island. I am a Christian and I hold my religion close to my heart. My accomplishments include being a participant in The Parsons Scholars Program as well as silver and gold keys in the Scholastic Art And Writing Awards. I have a blooming interest in acting, astronomy, and of course, the arts. Animation, my major in particular, has been quite the entertainment and I look forward to the wonders it can take me as I make a name for myself as an artist. 
          During my free time, I indulge in a good book and explore the world around me. I always am looking into the world to find new & interesting facts to learn, especially in science. My friends/family will ask me something that intrigues them and I am always there, ready and eager to share my findings. I love being able to help people acquire something interesting, it makes me feel good.
          I welcome you to accompany me in my journey. I don't know where I will go, but I know it will be great.</p>
